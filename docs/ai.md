# AI Guide

## Ask AI for Help

For simple questions or bugs, try asking AI tools such as DeepWiki or Claude Code.
You may be able to resolve issues much faster without waiting for a maintainer’s response.
Sharing AI-generated investigation results or proposed fixes in an issue can also help maintainers.
Rather than leaving everything to maintainers, actively using AI to investigate problems and showing a cooperative attitude can make it easier to receive support from them.
This project doesn't restrict the use of AI.

## Have AI Review Issues and Pull Requests

Have AI review your issues and pull requests to check whether all necessary information is included and to improve their overall quality. The questions AI asks you to clarify are often the same things maintainers would want to confirm.

## Take Responsibility for AI-Generated Content

When using AI to create issues or pull requests, clearly disclose that AI was used.
For example, you can add an AI agent as a co-author in commits or explicitly note when quoting AI-generated responses.

Before sharing AI-generated content, review it carefully and take responsibility for it.
If maintainers ask questions about the content, responding with “I don’t know because it was generated by AI” is not acceptable.
